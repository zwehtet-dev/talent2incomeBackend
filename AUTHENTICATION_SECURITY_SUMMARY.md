    - `*` - Full access for admin users
  - Token prefix for security scanning tools
  - Stateful domain configuration

### 2. Rate Limiting for Authentication Endpoints
- **Files**: 
  - `app/Http/Middleware/RateLimitMiddleware.php`
  - `app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php`
  - `routes/api.php`
- **Features**:
  - Authentication endpoints: 5 attempts per minute per IP
  - General API: 60 requests per minute per user/IP
  - Password reset: 3 attempts per hour per IP
  - Custom rate limiting headers in responses
  - IP-based and user-based rate limiting
  - Different limits for authenticated vs unauthenticated users

### 3. Custom Authentication Middleware with IP Tracking
- **File**: `app/Http/Middleware/AuthenticationMiddleware.php`
- **Features**:
  - IP address tracking and logging
  - User agent monitoring
  - Account lockout detection
  - Inactive account blocking
  - Comprehensive security logging
  - Request context tracking

### 4. Enhanced Password Hashing with Fallback Security
- **Files**: 
  - `config/hashing.php`
  - `app/Models/User.php`
  - `.env` and `.env.testing`
- **Features**:
  - Argon2id configuration (when available)
  - Bcrypt fallback with 12 rounds for compatibility
  - Secure password mutator in User model
  - Environment-specific configuration
  - Testing environment compatibility

### 5. Account Lockout After Failed Attempts
- **Files**: 
  - `app/Models/User.php`
  - `database/migrations/2025_08_09_171244_add_lockout_fields_to_users_table.php`
  - `app/Http/Controllers/Api/AuthController.php`
- **Features**:
  - Configurable maximum attempts (default: 5)
  - Configurable lockout duration (default: 15 minutes)
  - IP address tracking for failed attempts
  - Automatic lockout and unlock
  - Login history tracking (last 10 logins)
  - Lockout time remaining calculation

### 6. Token Abilities Middleware
- **File**: `app/Http/Middleware/CheckTokenAbilities.php`
- **Features**:
  - Validates token abilities for specific endpoints
  - Granular permission checking
  - Security logging for insufficient permissions
  - Flexible ability requirements per route

### 7. Comprehensive Security Configuration
- **File**: `config/security.php`
- **Features**:
  - CORS configuration
  - Content Security Policy settings
  - Security headers configuration
  - Rate limiting configuration
  - Password policy settings
  - Two-factor authentication preparation
  - IP filtering capabilities
  - Audit logging configuration

## Database Schema Enhancements

### User Table Security Fields
```sql
- failed_login_attempts (integer, default: 0)
- locked_until (timestamp, nullable)
- last_login_ip (string, nullable)
- last_login_at (timestamp, nullable)
- login_history (json, nullable)
```

## API Endpoints Enhanced

### Authentication Endpoints
- `POST /api/auth/register` - Rate limited (5/min)
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Rate limited (5/min) with lockout protection
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - Token revocation
- `POST /api/auth/forgot-password` - Rate limited (3/hour)
- `GET /api/auth/verify-email/{id}/{hash}` - Email verification
- `GET /api/auth/me` - Current user profile

### Security Features Applied
- All endpoints include rate limiting headers
- Authentication endpoints track IP addresses
- Failed login attempts trigger account lockout
- Tokens include expiration timestamps
- Comprehensive security logging

## Testing Implementation

### Test Files Created
- `tests/Feature/AuthenticationSecurityTest.php` - Comprehensive security tests
- `tests/Feature/SimpleAuthTest.php` - Basic authentication tests
- `tests/Feature/HashTest.php` - Password hashing verification

### Test Coverage
- Secure password hashing verification
- Token creation with custom abilities
- Admin token creation with full access
- Rate limiting enforcement
- Account lockout functionality
- IP address and login history tracking
- Inactive account blocking
- Token expiration handling
- Token revocation on logout
- Middleware security checks

## Configuration Files Updated

### Environment Configuration
- `.env` - Production configuration with Argon2id preference
- `.env.testing` - Testing configuration with bcrypt fallback

### Laravel Configuration
- `config/sanctum.php` - Token abilities and expiration
- `config/hashing.php` - Password hashing algorithms
- `config/auth.php` - Authentication and lockout settings
- `config/security.php` - Comprehensive security settings
- `bootstrap/app.php` - Middleware registration

## Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security (rate limiting, account lockout, IP tracking)
2. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Granular token abilities
3. **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging of security events
4. **Fail Secure**: Account lockout on suspicious activity
5. **Configuration Management**: Environment-specific security settings
6. **Input Validation**: Request validation and sanitization
7. **Session Management**: Secure token handling and expiration

## Performance Considerations

- Efficient database indexes on security fields
- Cached rate limiting using Laravel's built-in cache
- Optimized middleware stack
- Minimal overhead for security checks

## Monitoring and Logging

- Security events logged to dedicated channels
- Failed login attempt tracking
- Rate limiting violation logging
- Account lockout notifications
- IP address monitoring

## Future Enhancements Ready

The implementation provides a foundation for:
- Two-factor authentication
- Advanced threat detection
- Geographic IP filtering
- Device fingerprinting
- Advanced audit reporting

## Compliance Features

- GDPR-ready with data portability
- Audit trail for security events
- Configurable data retention
- Privacy controls implementation ready

This implementation provides enterprise-grade authentication security while maintaining performance and usability for the micro jobs platform.
